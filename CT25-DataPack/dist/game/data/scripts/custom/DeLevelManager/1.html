Hello there, if you want to low your current level, you came to right place!<br>
You have just to choose the <font color=FF0000>number</font> of level you would like to be.<br>
In exchange, i am going to take you <font color=LEVEL>%price% %itemname%</font> for <font color=LEVEL>each level
</font> you decrease.<br>
Remember: You can't choose a number higher than your current level.<br>
